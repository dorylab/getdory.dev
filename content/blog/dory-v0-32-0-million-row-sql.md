# Dory v0.32.0: Explore Millions of SQL Rows Without the Slowdown

![Dory v0.32.0 routes large SQL result sets through a DuckDB-inspired compute core into Parquet-backed, smoothly browsable data](/images/blog/dory-v0-32-0-no-limit-sql-cover-en.png)

Dory v0.32.0 is now available.

This release addresses a simple but persistent problem in data work: **why should you have to choose between complete query results and a responsive experience?**

With v0.32.0, you can run **no-limit SQL queries** and keep the complete result. Even when a query returns millions of rows, you can continue to browse, filter, sort, chart, and export the data directly in Dory.

You no longer need to truncate the data just to keep the interface responsive, or move the result to another tool before you can continue your analysis.

## Go beyond the first 200 rows

A default row limit is useful protection when you are exploring a large table. But when you intentionally need the complete result, that protection can become a barrier.

You can now select **No limit** in Dory's query settings. Dory will stop adding a `LIMIT` clause automatically and run the SQL as you wrote it.

Whether you are exporting every order, investigating anomalies scattered across a large table, or preparing a complete dataset for further analysis, you no longer need to work around the result limit.

You can keep a sensible default limit for everyday exploration and switch to No limit when the job calls for complete data. The choice between speed and completeness is now yours.

## Millions of rows, still smooth to explore

Returning a million rows is one thing. Making those rows genuinely usable is the harder problem.

Traditional result tables often try to load too much data into the browser at once. As the result grows, the wait gets longer, memory usage increases, and scrolling, filtering, and sorting become less responsive.

Dory v0.32.0 changes how large result sets are loaded. When you open one, Dory reads and renders only the portion you are currently viewing, then prepares nearby data as you scroll.

To you, it still behaves like one complete table:

- Scroll through and navigate result sets with millions of rows.
- Filter, search, and sort the complete result.
- Build charts from the full dataset, not just the first few hundred rows.
- Export filtered data as CSV or Parquet at any time.

The dataset can grow without changing how you work. You see the complete result while the browser handles only the small portion needed for the current view.

## Your result remains available after the query finishes

SQL results have traditionally been temporary. Close a tab, refresh the page, or switch workspaces, and you may need to run the query again.

In v0.32.0, Dory stores the complete result set in Parquet. After the query finishes, the result remains in your workspace so you can reopen it and continue where you left off.

That means you can:

- Run a query today and continue the analysis tomorrow.
- Move between SQL tabs without losing existing results.
- Preserve filter, sort, and selection state.
- Continue creating charts or exports from an existing result.

A query result is no longer a disposable response. It becomes a reusable data asset that you can keep exploring.

## DuckDB is becoming a core part of Dory's architecture

To make this experience possible, we have brought DuckDB into the core of Dory's application architecture in v0.32.0.

DuckDB is more than a behind-the-scenes query accelerator, and more than another database that Dory can connect to. It is becoming a shared computation layer that connects database results, files, and the analysis capabilities we build next.

Today, Dory stores complete result sets in Parquet and uses DuckDB to read and compute over them.

When you filter, sort, or search a result with millions of rows, Dory does not send the entire dataset to the browser first. DuckDB performs the operation directly on the Parquet result set, and Dory returns only the data needed for the current view.

That is what allows large result sets to remain fast to browse, analyze, chart, and export after they have been saved.

There is nothing new to configure. You do not need to manage DuckDB or Parquet files yourself. They work inside Dory so complete results and a responsive interface can exist together.

More importantly, this architecture lays the foundation for the next stage of file analysis in Dory. DuckDB is designed to query formats such as Parquet and CSV directly. Building on this foundation, we will expand Dory's support for local files and additional file formats, so you can open files, run SQL, combine data, and start analyzing without importing everything into a database first.

Million-row result sets are among the first capabilities delivered by this new architecture. Over time, database results and file data will share a more consistent analysis experience in Dory.

## One uninterrupted path from query to analysis

Dory v0.32.0 connects the large-result workflow from end to end:

1. Run the complete SQL query with **No limit**.
2. See a preview and live progress while the query runs.
3. Store the complete result set automatically in Parquet.
4. Explore millions of rows smoothly in Dory.
5. Keep filtering, sorting, charting, or exporting the result.

You no longer need to interrupt your work because a result is too large, or move data between several tools before you can reach an answer.

And with DuckDB at the core of Dory's application architecture, this workflow will not stop at database queries. Next, we will bring the same direct, responsive analysis experience to more file-based data.

## Dory v0.32.0 is available now

Data should not become unusable just because there is more of it.

Dory v0.32.0 lets you keep complete results without giving up a fast, responsive analysis experience. It also marks DuckDB's arrival at the core of Dory's architecture, preparing the foundation for the next generation of file analysis in Dory.

The next time you face a large table, turn off the `LIMIT` and see what is waiting in the complete result.
